# Sugar Web Template - Using COFFEE SCRIPT

A volo template for a sugar web activity in coffeescript! Also the css is using SASS!

Now writing web activities is so much easier!!!!

## How To

1. Go into osbuild:
    `~/sugar-build/osbuild shell`
2. Git the template: `git clone https://github.com/SAMdroid-apps/sugar-web-coffee-template`
3. Volo into action: `volo create NEW-ACTIVITY-NAME ./coffee-activity-template`
4. Get something to automatically compile the coffeescript and sass. I recommend
[Koala](http://koala-app.com/)
5. Setup your auto compiler, for Koala just do:
    - click `+` -> find your activity's folder -> select js
    - click `+` -> find your activity's folder -> select css
    - Make sure koala is always running

Now you can go and edit! The files are `index.html`, `css/activity.sass` and `js/activity.js`
